- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Ground clearance, vehicle weight and vehicle length (as well as the intercept).
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The P-value is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05, we can states the is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, ehich means that the slope of our linear model is not zero. 

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
Yes, we have enough significant variables that can predict the MPG of the prototypes. Yet, we can improve this model's performance by adding some more variables of interest.
